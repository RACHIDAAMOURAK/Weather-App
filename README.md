A Weather App built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript! üåç  

This app provides real-time weather updates for any city worldwide, featuring a clean and user-friendly interface. It was a great opportunity to work with APIs  and enhance my front-end development skills.  

Please Note:
to test this program replace "your api key" with your own API key in OpenWeatherMap .
in Java Script  file : const apikey="your api key"
